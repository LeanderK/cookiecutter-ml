Project Organization
------------

    ├── data               <- Folder for all the datasets used in the machine-learning project
    |
    ├── experiments        <- This folder is used for all the experiments and their results.
    |                         This is not the place for your preprocessing-code or layer-definitions.
    |                         It is recommended to think about a substructure depending on the nature
    |                         of the project. For example, one could groupy the experiments by
    |                         week/month/dataset.
    |
    ├── notebooks          <- The place for all your jupyter-notebooks. If the project involves a
    |                         lot of notebooks it is recommended to adopt a similiar structure to
    |                         the one used in `/experiments`.
    |
    ├── reports            <- Smaller reports and the code to generate the relevant figures belongs
    |                         here.
    |
    ├── src                <- Source code for the project.
    │   ├── data           <- Downloading, preprocessing and loading the datasets.
    │   ├── models         <- Here belongs all the code that is used to define your models.
    │   ├── training       <- The training and evaluation code.
